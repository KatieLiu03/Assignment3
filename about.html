        <p>Coco Chanel, also known as Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel was a French fashion designer. Her casual but elegant designs inspired the fashion industry to abandon uncomfortable styled clothing. Chanel believed that "luxury must be comfortable, otherwise it is not luxury", this is expressed through her designs. They are simple and comfortable, which revolutionized the fashion industry. One of her most popular innovations was the "little black dress", which is not a staple in many women's closets. Her creation of the Chanel No.5 perfume, in the 1920s, further solidified her position in the fashion industry. She was the first fashion designer to create a perfume and used a simple but sleek way to package it compared to other perfume brands at the time.</p>
